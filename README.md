# Project Overview: COVID-19 Data Exploration and Analysis with SQLite

# Data Sets
- [Covid Deaths](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx)
- [Covid Vaccination](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx)
  
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Explore all records from `CovidDeaths` and `CovidVaccinations` tables.
   
2. **Summarized Data:**
   - Summary of Covid cases and deaths by location and date.

3. **Specific Insights:**
   - Death percentage and infection rate in Indonesia.
   - Countries with the highest infection rates and death counts per population.

4. **Continental and Global Analysis:**
   - Death counts per population by continent.
   - Global cases and death percentage over time.

5. **Vaccination Analysis:**
   - Calculate the percentage of the population vaccinated using a CTE.

# Summary
This project involves exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data using SQLite. Key areas of focus include summarizing cases and deaths, calculating infection and death percentages, identifying countries and continents with the highest rates, and determining the percentage of the population vaccinated. The queries provide valuable insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally and regionally.
